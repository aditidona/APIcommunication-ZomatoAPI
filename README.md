# ZOMATO API-1
For this project, I am using the Zomato API.
Zomato APIs give you access to the freshest and most exhaustive information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally.
Zomato API documentation link: https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search?entity_id=1&entity_type=city&start=1&count=20

My Motivation for using Zomato API
By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of userâ€™s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.
We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not.
We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.
