## Application Program Interfaces
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
- In Data Science, API commmunications is integral part of Data Collection.
- For this project, I am using the Zomato API to fetch details about various restaurants and then deduce Information from the collected Data.

## My Motivation for using Zomato API:
-By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of userâ€™s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.
-We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not.
-We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.

## ZOMATO API-1
-Zomato API gives access to the freshest and most exhaustive information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally.
    -Zomato API documentation link: https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search?entity_id=1&entity_type=city&start=1&count=20

## ZOMATO API-2
-Data has been collected from the Zomato API in the form of .json files(raw data) using the API url and stored in CSV file (done in part-1).
-All the visualisations and deductions about restuarants, food, popularity etc are done in this part.
