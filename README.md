ZOMATO API-1
For this project, I am using the Zomato API.
Zomato APIs give you access to the freshest and most exhaustive information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally.
Zomato API documentation link: https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search?entity_id=1&entity_type=city&start=1&count=20
My Motivation for using Zomato API
By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of user’s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.
We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not.
We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.

ZOMATO API-2
Dataset Collection -
Due to Zomato API Basic Plan restriction, we cannot collect enough data for analysis. 
To overcome this problem ‘Zomato.csv’ file is provided to analyse the data deeply and to get useful inference.
Data has been collected from the Zomato API in the form of .json files(raw data) using the API url and stored in CSV file.
the CSV file has aslo been uploaded
